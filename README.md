# Tribute Game: The Simpsons Arcade
I paid a tribute to an old school arcade game by reproducing some of its features with SDL to create a single playable demo. 
## How to play
`[W|A|S|D]` - To move in the scene.
`[J]` - To jump.
`[K]` - To Attack.

-Debug Options
`[F1]` - Show colliders and player coordinates.
`[F2]` - Free Camera (still working on it).
`[F3]` - God Mode: Turns you invulnerable.
## Description
This game is a tribute to the old school game "The Simpsons Arcade".
In this demo you will find a reproduction of the Cementery Level of the game but just with one enemy due to the lack of spritesheets over Internet. 
## How to build
### Windows
With Visual Studio you need to put the Debug in x86 and modify the Game project properties to use the 'debugging' in `$(SolutionDir)external` instead of the default one.
### Linux
TODO
### MacOS
TODO
