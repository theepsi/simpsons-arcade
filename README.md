# Tribute Game: The Simpsons Arcade

I paid a tribute to an old school arcade game by reproducing some of its features with SDL to create a single playable demo.

## Description

This game is a tribute to the old school game "The Simpsons Arcade".
In this demo you will find a reproduction of the Cementery Level of the game but just with one enemy due to the lack of spritesheets over Internet.

## How to build

### Windows

With Visual Studio you need to put the Debug in x86 and modify the Game project properties to use the 'debugging' in `$(SolutionDir)external` instead of the default one.

### Linux
